# OptionsCalculator
Calculates the value of a call/put option and plots a portfolio of options
This android application allows users to value a put or a call option using the Black Scholes model. 
Users can also plot the payoff and profit diagrams for a portfolio of options and stock for a user-specified range of stock values. 
The motivation behind the app was a class in financial derivates that I took at UIUC. 
I wanted to get rid of excel files and provide an user friendly interface to calculate value of stock options and also view their payoff and profit graphically.
